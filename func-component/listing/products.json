If you&#39;ve ever struggled with achieving orgasm/climax, the jade egg will help awaken pleasure inside of the vaginal canal along with making it more supple yet strong. \n\nSize: 43mm x 30mm\n\nIf you want to experience more pleasure, love, creativity, and abundance while tapping fully into your orgasmic, erotic potential as a woman, the jade egg is a perfect tool for you!\n\nJade helps with releasing trauma, energetic blocks, opens the heart, and stimulates your sexual energy while awakening your sensuality and pleasure. Jade is also a stone tied to abundance, prosperity and good fortune. \n\nOnce you place an order, it will ship out within 1-3 business days. I will mail it in a small black velvet pouch. \n\nI will also send you an email with a free copy of my jade egg ebook so you can learn the secrets of the sexual practice that will help you awaken your sensuality, embody your pleasure, and find erotic ecstasy in your body as a woman! \n\nI&#39;ll also email you two guided mp3 practices and an instructional video that comes along with your jade egg purchase!

All of the eggs have been energetically cleansed and smudged with sage.\n\nDue to the intimate nature of the jade egg, I do not offer refunds, returns, or exchanges.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you are in US you have option to purchase insurance for your egg $2.99 so if you want to do this please message me so I can add this to your order (via paypal transfer of $2.99).
